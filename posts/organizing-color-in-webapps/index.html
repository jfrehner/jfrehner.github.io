    <h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>I always asked myself how different colors within a webapp could be organized so that it makes sense and is not overwhelming. In the past, I did not think much about it as my projects always had already a pretty much defined color palette and organized it neatly within various scss-variables.</p>
<p>But when I encountered a project where we had to build up the app from scratch, I noticed that I didn't like to define the colors &quot;on the fly&quot;. &quot;Oh we need a color for the menu-bar - define one in the menu-bar.scss&quot;, &quot;The footer needs a color? Declare it in the footer.scss&quot; and so on. This leads, consequently, to a beautiful mess - colors defined everywhere, maybe even the same shades that look like they are the same color, but might be off for a little bit etc.</p>
<p>I saw the problem: colors not defined and used consistently, but I did not know how to solve it. I knew there had to be a systematic approach on how one can organize color. So this post shall outline my ideas and thoughts about how I could define, organize and use color in webapps.
A word of caution: this is my personal opinion, work in progress and very much subject to change :)</p>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>The following is a collection of knowledge acquired from various articles available online (see at the end for a reference).</p>
<h5>Color types, color wheel, color palettes</h5>
<ul>
<li>The color wheel defines different colors
<ul>
<li>primary - yellow, red, blue</li>
<li>secondary - mixes of primary colors e.g. orange, green</li>
<li>tertiary - mix of a primary and secondary color e.g. yellow-green</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A color palette is a set of colors that work well together.</li>
<li>There are different types of color palettes (all based on the color wheel):
<ul>
<li>Analogous</li>
<li>Complementary</li>
<li>Split complementary</li>
<li>Double complementary (tetradic)</li>
<li>Triadic</li>
<li>Monochromatic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Create and use a color palette</h5>
<ul>
<li>Rather use fewer colors - it is easier to create visual hierarchy and contrast with ca. 3 - 5 colors than with more</li>
<li>Obviously: follow the color guidelines of your brand if there are any</li>
<li>Choose a color palette type to start with and iterate - change colors, add hues etc. in subsequent iterations if necessary</li>
<li>60 - 30 - 10 Rule: The dominant color should be used in 60% of cases, the secondary color in 30% and the accent color in around 10% of cases. Reason: this creates a nice balance and prevents a too colorful design</li>
<li>Pay attention to consistency: if red is used for error-messages, use it consistently for error-messages and not suddenly for a link etc.</li>
<li>Accent colors should only be used for things that should stand out</li>
<li>Don't use color alone to convey information - color blind people might not be able to perceive it correctly</li>
</ul>
<h5>Visual design</h5>
<p>This is not strictly only about color, but color plays obviously an important part in visual design.</p>
<p>Kelly Gordon (2020) mentions five principles</p>
<ol>
<li>Use relative size/scale to show importance and rank<br>
The most important elements need to be the biggest. Gordon suggests using no more than 3 different sizes.</li>
<li>Provide consistent visual hierarchy<br>
Guide the eye through the page so that it becomes clear what the importance of specific design elements are. Can be done through size, space, placement, colors etc.</li>
<li>Provide visual balance (using scale, color etc.) along an imaginary axis</li>
<li>Use contrast (e.g. in size, color etc.) to signify that elemetns differ</li>
<li>Use the gestalt principles (e.g. similarity, continuation, proximity etc.)</li>
</ol>
