    <h3>My Take on WCAG 2.1</h3>
<p>This only covers the WCAG 2.1 levels A and AA (not AAA) because in the project were I was involved we never aimed at level AAA (even W3 does not recommend that each site should meet level AAA - see also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html">the understanding section on WCAG2.0 conformance on the w3-website</a>). For different reasons we concluded that level AAA was not necessary for our site - and also practically not achievable.
It should also be noted that this list is very subjective and it will in no way grant level AA compliancy. That was never its goal. It is more to be seen as the things that I deemed to be relevant and important when trying to make a site more accessible. I hope that it helps me as a reference guide when I need to make sites accesible in the future - and I hope that you might also profit. You're free to copy the list and use it in your own project.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Please note that this is a sort of a &quot;living document&quot; in that I might update the list in the future if I find some points in the WCAG-documentation to be worthy of an upgrade/edit/delete. The list should stay mostly the same, but details can change.</p>
