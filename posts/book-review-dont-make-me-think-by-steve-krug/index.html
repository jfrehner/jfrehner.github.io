    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Another book on usability. One that might be considered a classic even? I don't know. Anyways, I recently read &quot;Don't make me think&quot; by Steve Krug. I grabbed the &quot;revisited&quot; edition (most notable addition is the part about mobile) from 2014 - so it's a bit dated but I still had hopes to find useful information. After all, usability patterns/behavior of people don't seem change as fast as Javascript-libraries (thank God...).
Let's get into it.</p>
<h3>Style of writing</h3>
<p>The book is quite easy to read even for usability beginners. The concepts are usually very well illustrated by screenshots or short cartoons explaining something in a funny but nonetheless concise way. I, for my part, liked that.</p>
<p>Another &quot;specialty&quot; of the book are its very descriptive headlines. Sometimes I almost didn't need to read the following paragraph but could scan the headline and get quite a good idea about the text below it. It seems that the author followed his own advice (omit needless words, structure your text etc.) thoroughly when writing those. To be completely honest, I sometimes didn't feel that I had to read the subsequent paragraph word for word to get the main point, since I already had a pretty good feeling about the covered topic by just reading the headline. So I just scanned the paragraph. Funnily enough, the author describes exactly this pattern for websites (it seems to be true for books as well): users don't read pages, they scan them. I would agree :)
So all in all, the book is very easy to read and I found it quite pleasant to read. It's not a scientific, hard-to-read-through, deep-thought-requiring book. But nonetheless it covers and brings accross important aspects of usability.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The book is divided into 13 chapters and covers a wide range of topics that are relevant when designing web sites such as use behavior, navigation, or how to establish simple but effective usability tests. In contrast to the writing style I have mixed feelings about the content. I really did like some of the points Steve Krug presented, but sometimes the explanations and recommendations were already known to me (e.g. use conventions, you can innovate but be careful etc.). At other times the information felt a bit dated e.g. when describing that global navigation should include the site's name, utilities, search etc.</p>
<p>All in all I would say this book is a very good read for beginner's in usability, and for engineers/web developers who want to get into usability. It really gives you quite a good oversight over the whole topic, although it can feel a bit dated sometimes. And, apart from user behavior related stuff, it also covers a wide range of organizational topics around usability as well: how do I usability test without a big budget? How can I convince my boss that we need to invest into usability?</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, this book is pleasant and very easy to read (not to say a joy with the illustrations). If you're a fast reader, have some knowledge/experience in usability and you sometimes scan pages instead of thoroughly reading them through, you might read the whole book in a couple of pages.
&quot;Don't make me think&quot; gives you a good idea about the important topics when working on making something (especially a website) usable. Furthermore, it helps you get started in setting up usability testing in your company and convincing your boss that you need it.
The downsides are the sometimes a bit outdated information and the lack of more in-depth information, such as underlying psychological principles or references to more in-depth material.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, I'll give &quot;Don't make me think&quot; by Steve Krug two ratings</p>
<ul>
<li>If you already have some experience in usability (e.g. you know that navigation is important, you have a rough idea what is important when testing usability etc.) I would rate the book at 3 out of 5 stars.
The book is easy to read, you will get something out of it but don't expect mind-blowing, new insights.</li>
<li>If you're a complete beginner to usability and want to learn about important topics in this broad field, then this book might be a good starter for you (although there might very well be better, more up-to-date introductory books as of now). I would rate this book then at 4 out of 5 stars.
The book is easy to read, you will get a good summary of what usability is about, but the information might be a bit outdated at times.</li>
