    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I recently joined a new project and therefore got a bit of a new focus. I work(ed) in both of these projects primarily as a frontend-engineer (though there are backends to the frontends, the majority of work and logic is done in the frontend). The shift to a new project was a good point for me to refocus on what I will learn next. Whereas in the old project I really dug into accessibility, WCAG etc. I now want to learn a bit more about usability.
When searching for appropriate resources I stumbled upon the small book &quot;Laws of UX&quot; by Jon Yablonski. It is accompanied by a website of the same name <a href="https://lawsofux.com/">&quot;Laws of UX&quot;</a>. As far as I understand it, Jon Yablonski first created the website and then expanded his ideas and thoughts into a small book (the book has more in-depth information about some of the principles but the website has more principles). &quot;Laws of UX&quot; is a collection of laws or principles that are useful to know when designing solutions.</p>
<h3>Short Review about &quot;Laws of UX&quot; by Jon Yablonski</h3>
<p>The book &quot;Laws of UX&quot; presents ten laws or principles of UX, explains them and some of the underlying psychological concepts (such as &quot;chunking&quot;). The same laws can be found on the website (and even more) but not explained in the same depth as in the book. Anyway, I found it useful to read through both: the website and the book. I usually started reading about a principle on the website and then turned to the book for more in-depth information.</p>
<h4>Contents</h4>
<p>The book covers the following ten laws/principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jakob's Law: Users expect your site to work as other sites where they spend their time on</li>
<li>Fitts's Law: The longer the distance to and the smaller the (touch-)target (such as a button) the longer it takes</li>
<li>Hick's Law: The more choices a user has and the more complex they are the longer it takes to make a decision</li>
<li>Miller's Law: User can usually keep 7 (plus minus 2) items in their memory</li>
<li>Postel's Law: Be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you send</li>
<li>Peak-End Rule: Users usually judge their experience based on how they felt at the peak and the end of an experience</li>
<li>Aesthetic Usability Effect: Aesthetically pleasing design can hide minor usability issues (also in usability tests!)</li>
<li>Von Restorff Effect: When a user sees multiple similar elements, the one that differs is most likely remembered</li>
<li>Tesler's Law: Each system contains an inherent complexity that cannot be removed and has to be tackled either by the system or the user</li>
<li>Doherty Threshold: Productiviy is at its highest when neither system nor user has to wait on each other (= sub-400ms response times)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I found the information very well researched and written. What I especially like about the websites are the links to additional resources/websites/blogs etc. about the specific principles (I found quite some good blogs in there e.g. <a href="https://andyrutledge.com/#articles">Andy Rutledge's blog</a> or the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/design-principles">collection about design principle articles on Smashing Magazine</a>). The book does not list these resources (interestingly - I suspect that the author might have added the resources to the website when the book was already written?) but it gives you a bunch of additional, oftentimes scientific, resources about the principles and their underlying psychological concepts. This is an important point: I really appreciate and like how the author based his writings on (scientific) resources and didn't just write stuff without a solid foundation. We all know these books where personal opinions are sold as &quot;principles&quot; the &quot;10 things you need to know to successfully make your users happy&quot; etc. This book is not that. Instead, these principles are carefully selected and described in a concise but nonetheless thorough way.</p>
<p>All in all, I would recommend the book to programmers who want to get into usability or usability engineers who want to have a small reminder about some important UX principles. Or, if you don't want to buy the book or if you're more of a website-reader-type-of-guy head over to <a href="https://lawsofux.com/">&quot;Laws of UX&quot;</a> and work through the principles there.
And as s a bonus: Jon Yablonski designed a graphic for each principle, condensed the whole law into a sentence and put the graphic and the sentence on a poster that can be hanged on your office wall. The small versions of the posters can be downloaded for free from the website, if you like you can also buy bigger versions.</p>
